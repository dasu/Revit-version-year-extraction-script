Revit-version-year-extraction-script
====================================

creates a report with central model info and what year the model is in.


Mostly proof of concept, and can be done on a more appropriate programming language, and probably with the revit API.  
Unfortunately there is no simple way of checking what version year a central model is in until you open it.  You can find metadata within the hex of the central model which does display the revit build of the model, and some other things as well.  
This shell script does exactly that, as effeciently to my best ability in bash...so not that well, but it does work.
